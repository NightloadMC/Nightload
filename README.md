# Nightload

Nightload is a Minecraft modding framework that aims to provide an easy and robust
way to deal with multi-version clients.

## Warning!

Nightload is not released, nor in a state where testing is available. Please open
pull requests to help us out with our goal to work in Minecraft 1.7 all the way up
to the latest versions.

## Installation

When we have made a working build ready for public use, downloads will be located at
the releases tab. Download the .JAR file that corresponds with the Minecraft version
you want to use. Next, put the .JAR file in your `.minecraft/mods` folder, and launch
the game using Fabric (1.14+) or Forge (1.7-1.13).

## Usage

When launching Minecraft with Nightload for the first time, your `.minecraft` directory
should now contain a folder called `nightload`. To launch a client made with Nightload,
simply put it in the `nightload` directory and launch Minecraft.

If you want to make a client with Nightload, check out our [Nightload-API](https://github.com/NightloadMC/Nightload-API)
repository, or clone our [Example-Client](https://github.com/NightloadMC/Example-Client) repository
for a fully working project.
